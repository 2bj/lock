## Terminology

- `Caller`: On object that can have permissions to do something
- `Driver`: A storage system for permissions which can either be static or persistent
- `Permission`: A permission holds an action and an optional (unique) resource. Can be either a `Restriction` or a `Privilege`
- `Restriction`: A restriction denies you from being able to perform an action on an (optional) resource
- `Privilege`: A privilege allows you to perform an action on an (optional) resource
- `Action`: An action is something you are either allowed or denied to do
- `Resource`: A resource can be an object where you can perform one or more actions on. It can either target a certain type of resources or a specific resource by its unique identifier

## Introduction

Lock differs from other Acl packages by trying to provide the most flexible way for working with multiple permission callers and storing permissions.

By working with Lock's `Caller` contract you can set permissions on multiple identities.

The `Driver` contract allows for an easy way to store permissions to a persistent or static storage system. A default static `ArrayDriver` ships with this package. Check out the list below for more drivers which have already been prepared for you. Or build your own by implementing the `Driver` contract.

You can set and check permissions for resources by manually passing along a resource's type and (optional) identifier or you can implement the `Resource` contract onto your objects so you can pass them along to lock more easily.

## Drivers

If you need a framework-specific implementation, pick one of the already prepared drivers below.

- ArrayDriver (ships with this package)
- Laravel (coming soon)

## Roadmap

- Action Aliases
- Permission Conditions
- Roles
- Group Permissions
- More drivers (Symfony, Zend Framework, Doctrine, ...)
- Event Listeners

## Installation

Install this package through Composer.

```bash
composer require beatswitch/lock
```

## Usage

### Implementing the Caller contract

Every identity which should have permissions to do something must implement the `Caller` contract. The `Caller` contract identifies a caller by requiring it to return its type and its unique identifier. Let's look at an example below.

```php
<?php

use BeatSwitch\Lock\Contracts\Caller;

class User implements Caller
{
    public function getCallerType()
    {
        return 'users';
    }

    public function getCallerId()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }
}
```

By adding the `getCallerType` function we can identify a group of callers through a unique type. If we would at some point wanted to set permissions on another group of callers we could easily implement the contract on another object.

```php
<?php

use BeatSwitch\Lock\Contracts\Caller;

class Organization implements Caller
{
    public function getCallerType()
    {
        return 'organizations';
    }

    public function getCallerType()
    {
        return $this->id;
    }
}
```

And thus we can easily retrieve permissions for a specific caller type through a persistent storage driver.

### Working with a static driver

If you'd like to configure all of your permissions beforehand you can use the static `ArrayDriver` which ships with the package. This allows you to set a list of permissions for a caller at runtime.

```php
use \BeatSwitch\Lock\Drivers\ArrayDriver;
use \BeatSwitch\Lock\Lock;

// Instantiate the Lock instance with the static ArrayDriver.
$lock = new Lock($caller, new ArrayDriver());

// Set some permissions.
$lock->allow('manage_settings');
$lock->allow('create', 'events');

// Use the Lock instance to validate permissions on the given caller.
$lock->can('manage_settings'); // true: can manage settings
$lock->can('create', 'events'); // true: can create events
$lock->cannot('update', 'events'); // true: cannot update events
$lock->can('delete', 'events'); // false: cannot delete events
```

### Working with a persistent driver

Working with **a persistent driver** allows you to store permissions to a persistent storage layer and adjust them during runtime. For example, if you'd implement the Laravel driver, it would store the permissions to a database using Laravel's database component. By creating your own UI, you could easily attach the acl functionality from this package to create, for example, a user management system where different users have different permissions.

Let's take a look at a very basic user management controller to see how that's done. We'll assume we get a bootstrapped lock manager instance with our Laravel DB driver.

```php
<?php

use BeatSwitch\Lock\Manager;

class UserManagementController extends BaseController
{
    protected $lockManager;

    public function __construct(Manager $lockManager)
    {
        $this->lockManager = $lockManager;
    }

    public function togglePermission()
    {
        $userId = Input::get('user');
        $action = Input::get('action');
        $resource = Input::get('resource');

        $user = User::find($userId);

        $this->lockManager->caller($user)->toggle($action, $resource);

        return Redirect::route('user_management');
    }
}
```

Every time the `togglePermission` method is used, the user's permission for the given action and resource type will be toggled.

### Setting a God caller

You could easily set a caller which has all permissions for everything by passing the `all` wildcard as an action on the lock instance.

```php
use \BeatSwitch\Lock\Drivers\ArrayDriver;
use \BeatSwitch\Lock\Lock;

// Instantiate the Lock instance.
$lock = new Lock($caller, new ArrayDriver());

// Set a single permission with the `all` wildcard.
$lock->allow('all');
```

Now every "can" method call will validate to true.

## Api

The following methods can all be called on a valid `Lock` instance.

`can(string $action, string|Resource $resource = null, int $resourceId = null)`

Checks to see if the current caller has permission to do something.

`cannot(string $action, string|Resource $resource = null, int $resourceId = null)`

Checks to see if it's forbidden for the current caller to do something.

`allow(string $action, string|Resource $resource = null, int $resourceId = null)`

Sets a `Privilege` permission on a caller to do something. Removes any matching restrictions.

`deny(string $action, string|Resource $resource = null, int $resourceId = null)`

Sets a `Restriction` permission on a caller to do something. Removes any matching privileges.

`toggle(string $action, string|Resource $resource = null, int $resourceId = null)`

Toggles the return value for the given permission.
